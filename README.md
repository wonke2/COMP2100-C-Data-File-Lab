# COMP2100-C-Data-File-Lab
## Introduction
This is the first of two programming task assignments in COMP2100. In this assignment, you will work with binary data stored in files, using the Unix I/O interface to read and write such files.

## Overview
Data files exist in various formats. In Unix, text files are common for simple data, but large data files are stored as binary data. In this lab assignment (programming task), you will be developing programs to read, write, modify, and reformat the data in binary data files. The assignment consists of a sequence of stages which build on each other. The first three stages develop your skills. In the final stage you will reverse engineer a data file using your knowledge of data representations. You have the choice between an easier final stage (stage 4) that can earn you at most 3 marks for the stage, or a more difficult final stage (stage 5) worth up to 4 marks for the stage. You may attempt both stages 4 and 5, but only the maximum of the two marks will count towards your total.
